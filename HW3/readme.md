I found myself getting confused in the order for question responses when trying to develop my story. I utilize the code created by my instructor and manipulated it from there. This was likely a contributing factor to my confusion. Had I genterated the code from scratch I would have likely not gotten mixed up within my story.

Overall I am enjoying Javascript but it is going to take me some practice.
