I thought I was on a good roll and got myself a little confused when editing your example code. I thought I had corrected the error but alas I did not. I cannot get the live source page to function on the click.

Additionally, I did not play with the style sheet. Once I hit the road block trying to correct the error I did not get back to the stylesheet.
