I am struggling to get all of my images to work properly in the memory game. I cannot find my issue with getting the images to link properly. Also, I am having issues getting the correct amount of the same image. So, sometimes I get 3 of the same photo and only 1 of the other in the 4 squares that do function properly.

I am assuming that my issues is in the <div class="divTableRow"> but cannot figure it out.
