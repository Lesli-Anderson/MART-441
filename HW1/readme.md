441 HW1 - Wow, where to begin? I felt overwhelmed this week in trying to remember HTML & CSS enough to develop from the ground up. Since I am taking this class along with its prerequisite at the same time, I feel I am behind the curve as far as my classmate and probably not at the level I should be. However, I will not allow this to disable me from achieving success. I know that my site is not the best right now but I will get it there by the end of the semester. When I first learned code there was nothing like Visual Studio Code and I haven't ever used Github, so tons of new skills this week.
