I really enjoyed this week. I found the pace and video parts to be very helpful for my understanding.

I tried to work with a walking piece of cake but it wouldn't display correctly. I also tried to use a cupcake "cake" as the bomb, which I was able to get to work correctly.

I am excited to play with this more. I am confused as to why the changed files display differently.

Notes to self:
jump with spacebar
change gravity
change sprite (issues)
add spikes or maybe more bombs
add other collectables (stars)
add new level when start collected and display current level.
