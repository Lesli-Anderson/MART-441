Ripples of Loss, by Terry McCue
“Alberta artist Terry McCue was so moved the first time he heard about the REDress movement, he was inspired to come up with his own tribute to missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. A year and a half later, the Ojibway painter has a series of 16 works, making up the exhibit Ripples of Loss. “This is the most important work in my career,” said McCue, 72.”

She is Missing, by
Soni Lopez-Chavez
"Every single person that is missing deserves the same attention and care given to their case," says artist Soni Lopez-Chavez. "Her life matters just as much as the next. Bring them home. All of them. Sending prayers to all the families."
