            <p>This will be the main page for Lesli's homework. I look forward to further developing my skillsets in this class. I feel very behind at the moment, but I will not give up!</p>
            <h2>A little about me!</h2>
            <p> Hello, My name is Lesli Anderson and I am a senior in Media Arts. A little about myselfâ€¦I am a non-traditional student. I have a certificate in Digital Arts and Design and an Associates in Media Design. I have been working professionally as a graphic designer in different roles since 2006. Since my primary focus has been that graphic design my web skills could use a tune-up, to say the least. I am currently the only full-time faculty member and the Dept Chair for the Digital Design Technology program at Salish Kootenai College. So I teach 15 credits a quarter (quarter system not semester) and I am a part-time online student with only 6 credits. 
                Since my focus has been primarily on graphic design, my web design skills are weak so I look forward to enhancing these skills. I know enough HTML and CSS to get into trouble. Most of my web design time since I started is working in different CMSs.             
                I am also taking MART 341 this semester which I hope will not cause too many issues.
                I look forward to getting back to the swing of things as far as building websites and am excited for this semester.</p>
